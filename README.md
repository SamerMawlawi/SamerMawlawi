  - Example: "Complete the project within 3 months, with regular updates every 2 weeks."

###  Step 2: Create a Timeline
- Use a simple timeline to plan out your key milestones. Example:
  - **Milestone 1**: Define scope by **YYYY-MM-DD**.
  - **Milestone 2**: Complete task breakdown by **YYYY-MM-DD**.
  
###  Step 3: Set Priorities for Tasks
- Break down tasks into priorities: High, Medium, Low. This will help you focus on what's most important.

###  Step 4: Assign Tasks to Team Members
- If you are working in a team, assign tasks and responsibilities to each team member.

###  Step 5: Regularly Update the Project

### Step 1: Set Up Meeting Notes
- For every meeting or discussion, create a new **Meeting Notes** document in StackEdit.
  - Include the date, attendees, and discussion points.
  
### Step 2: Organize Notes by Topics
- Break the notes into **Topics** or **Discussion Points** so they are easy to reference later.

### Step 3: Track Action Items
- Use checkboxes `[ ]` to track action items. This ensures that tasks are easily visible.
  - Example:
    - [ ] Person A to finalize project goals by **YYYY-MM-DD**.
    - [ ] Person B to draft the project timeline by **YYYY-MM-DD**.

###  Step 4: Review Notes Regularly
- Go over past meeting notes during follow-up meetings to track progress.
- Mark completed action items with `[x]` to show they’ve been finished.

### Step 5: Store Notes Safely
- Sync your StackEdit documents to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** to ensure your notes are safely backed up.

###  Problem 1: Unable to Manage Tasks Properly ❌
- **Solution**: Ensure that you’ve categorized tasks under appropriate sections (To-Do, In Progress, Completed). Use priorities (High/Medium/Low) to focus on what’s most important.

###  Problem 2: Meeting Notes Are Disorganized 📝
- **Solution**: Break notes into topics, and use checkboxes to track action items. Ensure that the meeting notes template is used consistently.

###  Problem 3: Tasks Not Syncing Across Team Members 🔄
- **Solution**: Check if everyone has enabled real-time synchronization using Google Drive or Dropbox. Ensure that the document permissions allow team members to edit.
# Emphasis in Project Planning and Note Management

### Highlighting Important Tasks 🔴
- Use **bold text** to emphasize key tasks or milestones in your project timeline.
Example:
```
**Complete project scope by YYYY-MM-DD.**
```
### Marking Tasks with Deadlines 🕒

-   Use _italic text_ to highlight upcoming deadlines or action items in meeting notes. 
Example:
```
_Please submit the report by next Monday, YYYY-MM-DD._
```
### Combining Bold and Italics for Critical Items ❗

-   When a task is both important and urgent, combine bold and italics for extra emphasis. 
Example:
```
***Finish the final review by Friday, YYYY-MM-DD.***
```
### Striking Through Completed Tasks ✅

-   Once a task is completed, strike through the text to visually mark it as done in your task management. Example:
```
~~Define project goals~~
```
